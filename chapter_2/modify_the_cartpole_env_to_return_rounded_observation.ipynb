    "## In this exercise, your job will be to write a wrapper `RoundObservation` that rounds the elements of the observation to a number of decimal places. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You should be able to create a wrapped environment with the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    rounded_observation_cartpole_env = RoundObservation(env=gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\"), decimals=2)\n",

    "2. The following code \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    observation = rounded_observation_cartpole_env.reset()\n",
    "    print(observation)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    should output something like\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    [-0.05  0.03  0.03 -0.04]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, the exact values are unimportant but **notice how the elements of the observation have been rounded upto the second decimal place**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Subsequently, the following code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    observation, reward, done, _ = rounded_observation_cartpole_env.step(0)\n",
    "    print(observation)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    should output something like\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    [-0.04 -0.16  0.03  0.26]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Notice again how the elements of the observation have been rounded upto the second decimal place.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since the observation is returned by both `reset()` and `step()` method, you would need to override both these functions in the wrapper to return rounded observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For rounding, the `numpy.around()` function might be useful. Here's the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.around.html?highlight=around#numpy.around) for that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To accept the number of decimal places as a argument to the wrapper, you will also need to override the `__init__()` method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Are you ready to define such a wrapper? I have supplied a skeleton of the wrapper below, but you need to do the rest. In doubt, refer to the `InitMod` wrapper's code given above.\n",
